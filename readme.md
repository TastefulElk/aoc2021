# Advent of Code 2021

Using AoC to learn some Python! Happy for any feedback because I have no idea what I'm doing!

## Running

To run a specific day and part, run the root `app.py` with the day and part as arguments.

For example, to run day two, part one:

```sh
python src/app.py --day 2 --part 1
```

It's also possible to use the example data from the challenge description by adding a `--example` flag.

```sh
python src/app.py --day 2 --part 1 --example
```

## Testing

Run all tests by running:

```sh
python -m unittest
```

or run a specific test by running:

```sh
python -m unittest path/to/test
```
